# Shortening a URL

To shorten a URL using the Kuts API, you can make a `GET` request to the `/short` endpoint with the following parameters:

### Example

```plaintext
GET https://kuts.club/short?url=https://naai.nz
```

This will then return a HTML response with the shortened URL in the following format:
    
    ```html
    <a href='https://kuts.club/g/qurGpm'>https://kuts.club/g/qurGpm</a>
    ```

You can extract the shortened URL from the response and use it in your application.
#### Parameters

- url: The URL you want to shorten. For example, https://naai.nz.
