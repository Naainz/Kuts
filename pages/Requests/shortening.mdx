# Shortening a URL

To shorten a URL using the Kuts API, you can make a `GET` request to the `/short` endpoint with the following parameters:

### Example

```plaintext
GET https://kuts.club/short?url=https://naai.nz
```

This will then return a HTML response with the shortened URL in the following format:
    
    ```html
    https://kuts.club/g/qurGpm
    ```

You can extract the shortened URL from the response and use it in your application.
#### Parameters

- url: The URL you want to shorten. For example, https://naai.nz.


## Use of custom slugs

You can also use custom slugs for your shortened URLs, provided that the slug is not already taken, and it is between 7 and 15 characters. To do this, you can make a `GET` request to the `/short` endpoint with the following parameters:

### Example

```plaintext
GET https://kuts.club/short?url=https://naai.nz&slug=naainz
```

This will then return a HTML response with the shortened URL in the following format:
    
    ```html
    https://kuts.club/g/naainz
    ```

#### Parameters

- url: The URL you want to shorten. For example, https://naai.nz.
- slug: The custom slug you want to use. For example, naainz.
