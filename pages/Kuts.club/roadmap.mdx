# Roadmap

Kuts.club is a project that aims to provide a simple and easy-to-use URL shortening service. The API allows users to create short links for long URLs, as well as retrieve information about existing links. The project is open-source and free to use, and we welcome contributions from the community.

## Our plans:

- ~~Allow users to customize short URLs with a custom alias.~~ [Beta 0.9.1]
- ~~Implement a user authentication system to manage links and track analytics. [SCRAPPED]~~
- ~~Add support for QR codes to easily share short links.~~ [Beta 0.9.2]
- Integrate with popular social media platforms for easy sharing.
- ~~Implement a browser extension for quick URL shortening. [SCRAPPED]~~
- Add support for custom domains.
- Add support for password-protected links. 
- Enable user-decided link-expiry.
- Bulk shortening.
- Geographical targeting (sends users to different links based on their region).
- Device targeting (sends users to create links that redirect to different URLs based on the user's device type (e.g., mobile, desktop, tablet))
- Affiliated links.
