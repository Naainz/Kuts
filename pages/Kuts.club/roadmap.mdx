# Roadmap

Kuts.club is a project that aims to provide a simple and easy-to-use URL shortening service. The API allows users to create short links for long URLs, as well as retrieve information about existing links. The project is open-source and free to use, and we welcome contributions from the community.

## Our plans:

- Allow users to customize short URLs with a custom alias.
- Implement a user authentication system to manage links and track analytics.
- Add support for QR codes to easily share short links.
- Integrate with popular social media platforms for easy sharing.
- Implement a browser extension for quick URL shortening.
- Add support for custom domains.
- Add support for password-protected links.
